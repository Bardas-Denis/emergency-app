# Triggers: Run this pipeline when code is pushed to main or a pull request is made

  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

    steps:
      # 1. Download your code to the virtual machine
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Java (Android Studio currently uses Java 17 by default)
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'

      # 3. Make the Gradle script executable
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # 4. Try to Build the App (Debug version)
      # This checks for compilation errors and syntax mistakes
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug

      # 5. Run Lint (Optional but recommended)
      # Checks for code style issues and potential bugs
      - name: Run Lint
        run: ./gradlew lintDebug

      # 6. Run Tests (Even if you don't have them yet, keep this here for later)
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
